# API project

## Description
This project was during my 4th year as a high school engineering student at NTI Södertörn.
In this project we used 3 different API's one for bus and train departure, one for current weather and date, at last one for top current most selling books.

## Dependencies
Create and design a page for each of the three different APIs, showcasing their respective information. 
For styling I used Bootstrap in this case

### API 1 / Bus and Train
In this API we fetched the departure and arrival time for a selected area which is Sundyberg in this case. 
I made them into a list showcasing their  arrival- and departure time also their destination.

### API 2 / Weather API
In this API we fetched the current weather and date for a selected area which is Manila for this case. 
I made two different design, one is made into a  list and the other one is made into a weather card.

### API 3 / Book API
In this API we fetched the current top 5 most selling book by NY - times. 
I made them into a list showcasing their author, title, position and img.
They are also sorted from most selling to least selling.
